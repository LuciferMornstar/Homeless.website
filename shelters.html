                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">What is the 56-Day Rule?</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4"></p>
                        Under the Homelessness Reduction Act 2017, local councils have a legal duty to help prevent your homelessness if you are threatened with homelessness within 56 days (8 weeks). This is known as the "Prevention Duty."
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        <strong>Important:</strong> This is twice as long as the previous 28-day rule, giving you more time to get help before you actually become homeless.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        If you're already homeless, councils have a "Relief Duty" to help you secure accommodation for at least 6 months.
                    </p>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        The 56-day period starts when either:

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                        <li>You notify the council that you're at risk of homelessness within 56 days</li>
                        <li>You receive a valid Section 21 notice from your landlord (the "no-fault" eviction notice)</li>
                        <li>Your fixed-term tenancy is ending within 56 days</li>
                        <li>You're asked to leave family/friends accommodation within 56 days</li>
                        <li>You're at risk of losing your home for any other reason within 56 days</li>
                    </ul>

                    </p>
                    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Right to prevention assistance</strong> - If you're at risk of homelessness within 56 days</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Right to relief assistance</strong> - If you're already homeless</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Right to a written assessment</strong> - Covering your circumstances and needs</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Right to a Personalized Housing Plan</strong> - With specific steps for you and the council</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Right to information</strong> - About your housing options and available support</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Right to emergency accommodation</strong> - If you're in priority need and homeless</li>
                        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Right to review decisions</strong> - If you disagree with the council's assessments</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to access your case records</strong> - To see what information the council holds</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Remember:</strong> These rights apply regardless of whether you're considered to be in "priority need" or "intentionally homeless" during the prevention and relief stages.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Priority Need Categories</h3>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        While the 56-day rule applies to everyone, those in "priority need" have additional rights, particularly for emergency accommodation. You may be in priority need if:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                        <li>You have dependent children living with you</li>
                        <li>You're pregnant</li>
                        <li>You're homeless due to domestic abuse</li>
                        <li>You're vulnerable due to old age, mental illness, disability, or other special reason</li>
                        <li>You're aged 16-17 (or 18-20 if previously in care)</li>
                        <li>You're homeless due to an emergency such as flood or fire</li>
                        <li>You're vulnerable as a result of leaving the armed forces, prison, or care</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        <strong>What "vulnerable" means:</strong> The legal test is whether you would be "significantly more vulnerable than an ordinary person would be if they became homeless." This is assessed on a case-by-case basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even if you don't fall into these categories, the council still has duties to help under the 56-day rule.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Councils may assess whether you became homeless "intentionally." This means you deliberately did or failed to do something that led to your homelessness.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        <strong>Important:</strong> Even if the council believes you're intentionally homeless, they still must help you under the 56-day Prevention and Relief Duties.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Examples that are usually NOT considered intentional:

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                        <li>Leaving accommodation due to domestic abuse</li>
                        <li>Being unable to afford rent due to a genuine financial crisis</li>
                        <li>Being evicted because your landlord wants to sell or move back in</li>
                        <li>Living in poor conditions that affected your health</li>
                        <li>Losing your home after a relationship breakdown</li>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        If the council decides you're intentionally homeless, you can:

                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
                        <li>Ask for a review of this decision within 21 days</li>

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        When approaching the council for help, try to bring as much of the following documentation as possible:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="checklist">
                        <li>ID documents (passport, driving license, birth certificate)</li>
                        <li>Immigration status documents (if applicable)</li>
                        <li>Eviction notice or section 21 notice (if you've received one)</li>
                        <li>Tenancy agreement</li>
                        <li>Letters from landlord or family/friends asking you to leave</li>
                        <li>Medical evidence (doctor's letters about health conditions)</li>
                        <li>Evidence of income (payslips, benefit letters)</li>
                        <li>Information about your current housing situation</li>
                        <li>Details of any support workers or social workers</li>
                        <li>Evidence of domestic abuse (if applicable and safe to provide)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-4">
                        <strong>Remember:</strong> If you don't have all these documents, the council should still help you. They can't refuse to take a homelessness application because you don't have certain documents.
