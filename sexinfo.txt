Safe Sex and Homelessness: A Practical UK Guide
This guide provides detailed information on navigating sexual health and safety while experiencing homelessness in the UK. It's crucial to prioritize your well-being and make informed decisions, even in challenging circumstances.
Understanding the Challenges
Homelessness creates significant obstacles to maintaining sexual health:
Lack of Privacy: Finding private and safe spaces for sexual activity is difficult.
Limited Access to Resources: Access to condoms, lubricant, and healthcare services may be restricted.
Increased Risk of STIs: The risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is higher due to limited access to testing and treatment.
Vulnerability: Homelessness can increase vulnerability to sexual assault and exploitation.
Barriers to Services: People experiencing homelessness may face barriers in accessing services due to lack of documentation, mistrust of services, fear of criminalization, and stigma.
Co-occurring Issues: Often, those experiencing homelessness have co-occurring mental health and/or substance use issues, further complicating access to and engagement with sexual health services.
Survival Sex: Some individuals may engage in survival sex work, increasing their vulnerability to STIs, exploitation, and violence.
Mental Health: The stress and trauma of homelessness can significantly impact mental health, which in turn can affect decision-making around sexual health and increase vulnerability.
Substance Use: Substance use can impair judgment, increase risk-taking behavior, and make it more difficult to access and adhere to sexual health services.
Finding Safe Spaces
Shelters: Some shelters may offer private spaces or allow couples to stay together. Policies vary, so check with individual shelters.
Inquire about specific policies regarding visitors and overnight stays.
Some shelters may have designated areas for private conversations or medical consultations.
Temporary Accommodation: If provided by the council, this may offer more privacy, but safety and security can still be concerns.
Assess the safety and security of the accommodation, including locks, lighting, and neighborhood safety.
Report any concerns about safety to the council or accommodation provider.
Public Spaces: If other options are unavailable, seek secluded outdoor areas. Be aware of legal issues and safety risks.
Be aware of the potential for exposure to the elements and the risk of assault or harassment.
Prioritize locations that are well-lit and relatively close to potential sources of help.
Hotels/Motels: Pooling resources may allow for short-term private and safer spaces.
Consider the cost and feasibility of this option, as well as the potential for exploitation or theft.
Ensure the accommodation is reputable and has adequate security measures.
Community Organizations: Some organizations serving the homeless may assist in finding safe spaces or offer relevant information.
Connect with local organizations that provide support services, such as drop-in centers or outreach programs.
These organizations may have knowledge of safe spaces or be able to advocate for your needs.
Healthcare Facilities: Some healthcare facilities may have private areas or resources.
Sexual health clinics and GP surgeries offer confidential consultations and examinations.
Some hospitals may have private rooms for patients, although this is typically for medical needs.
Sexual Health Clinics: These clinics provide confidential services and a safe environment to discuss concerns.
Sexual health clinics (also known as GUM clinics) offer a range of services, including STI testing and treatment, contraception, and sexual health advice.
All services are confidential, regardless of age.
Legal Considerations in the UK
Sexual Offences Act 2003: This is the primary legislation concerning sexual offences in England and Wales. It details offences such as rape, sexual assault, and assault by penetration. Key principles include:
Consent: Consent must be voluntary and informed. Sections 75 and 76 of the Act outline circumstances where a person is deemed not to have consented.
Section 75 outlines evidential presumptions about consent (e.g., use of violence).
If certain circumstances are proven, the defendant must prove that the complainant consented and that the defendant reasonably believed the complainant consented. These circumstances include the use of violence or threats of violence.
Section 76 outlines conclusive presumptions about consent (e.g., person deceived about the nature or purpose of the act).
In these circumstances, it is irrebuttable that the complainant did not consent. These circumstances include where the complainant was deceived as to the nature or purpose of the sexual act.
Reasonable Belief: An accused person's belief in consent must be reasonable, considering all circumstances and any steps taken to ascertain consent.
The Act emphasizes that it is not enough for a defendant to simply claim they believed the complainant consented; that belief must be objectively reasonable.
Public Sex: Sexual activity in public is illegal and can lead to arrest. Laws vary, and awareness of specific regulations is crucial.
Indecent exposure and public sexual indecency are offenses under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and common law.
Local councils may also have bylaws prohibiting certain behaviors in public spaces.
Sex Work:
The exchange of money for sex is not inherently illegal.
However, related activities are criminalized:
Soliciting: This involves persistently approaching or importuning someone for the purpose of prostitution.
Kerb crawling: This is soliciting for sex from a motor vehicle.
Operating a brothel: This refers to premises used by more than one sex worker.
Pimping and pandering: These involve activities such as controlling prostitution for gain.
Advertising prostitution
Those involved in sex work, particularly those experiencing homelessness, are at increased risk of exploitation, violence, and legal repercussions.
Homelessness can increase vulnerability to exploitation and trafficking, as individuals may be more dependent on others for shelter and basic needs.
Reporting Sexual Assault:
Report to the police immediately.
Early reporting is crucial for evidence preservation and access to support services.
Rape Crisis centers offer support and advocacy (0808 802 9999).
Rape Crisis provides confidential support, information, and advocacy to women and girls who have experienced any form of sexual violence.
NHS Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs) provide specialized medical and psychological care.
SARCs offer forensic medical examinations, STI testing, emergency contraception, and crisis counseling.
Services are free and confidential, and you can self-refer.
Exploitation: The CPS prosecutes those who force others into prostitution, exploit, abuse, and harm them.
The CPS plays a crucial role in prosecuting cases involving sexual exploitation and trafficking, seeking to bring perpetrators to justice and protect victims.
Protecting Your Health
Condoms:
Use condoms (male or female) every time you have sex to prevent STIs and unwanted pregnancies.
Carry condoms and store them properly.
Store condoms in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and sharp objects.
Check the expiration date before use.
Free condoms are available from many NHS services, sexual health clinics, and some charities.
Many local councils and charities also provide free condoms through outreach programs or community distribution points.
Lubricant: Use water-based lubricant to reduce friction and prevent condom breakage. Available at pharmacies and sexual health clinics.
Water-based lubricants are generally safe to use with all types of condoms.
Avoid oil-based lubricants, as they can damage condoms.
STI Testing:
Get tested regularly, even without symptoms, as many STIs are asymptomatic.
Free STI testing is available through the NHS at sexual health clinics (GUM clinics), some GP surgeries, and community testing events.
Testing is confidential and results are typically available within a few days.
Regular testing is recommended for anyone who is sexually active, especially those with multiple partners or who engage in high-risk sexual behavior.
Vaccinations:
Vaccination against HPV and hepatitis B is recommended and available through the NHS.
The HPV vaccine protects against the most common types of HPV that can cause genital warts and cervical cancer.
The hepatitis B vaccine protects against a liver infection that can be transmitted through sexual contact.
Emergency Contraception:
Use after unprotected sex or condom failure to prevent pregnancy.
Available from pharmacies, sexual health clinics, and some GP surgeries. Some are free, and some you have to pay for.
Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are most effective when taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex.
The copper intrauterine device (IUD) is the most effective form of emergency contraception and can be inserted up to five days after unprotected sex.
PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis):
Medication to prevent HIV infection.
Available through the NHS to those at high risk.
PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV when taken as prescribed.
Eligibility for PrEP is assessed based on individual risk factors.
PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis):
Emergency medication to prevent HIV infection after potential exposure.
Must be started within 72 hours of exposure.
Available from sexual health clinics and A&E departments.
PEP involves taking a course of antiretroviral medication for 28 days.
It is important to complete the full course of PEP to maximize its effectiveness.
Common STIs and their implications
Chlamydia:
Often asymptomatic, but can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, leading to infertility.
Easily treated with antibiotics.
Gonorrhea:
Can cause painful urination, discharge, and inflammation.
If untreated, can lead to serious complications, including infertility and disseminated infection.
Increasing antibiotic resistance is a concern.
Syphilis:
Progresses through stages, with potentially severe consequences if untreated, including neurological damage and death.
Treated with penicillin.
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus):
Attacks the immune system, making individuals vulnerable to other infections and cancers.
While there is no cure, antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively control the virus and allow people with HIV to live long and healthy lives.
Genital Herpes:
Causes painful blisters and outbreaks.
There is no cure, but antiviral medications can help manage symptoms and reduce transmission.
Genital Warts:
Caused by HPV, can cause warts on the genitals and anus.
Some types of HPV can also cause cancer.
Treated with topical medications, cryotherapy, or other procedures.
Hepatitis B:
A viral infection that affects the liver.
It can cause both acute and chronic illness.
Vaccination is available.

Important Considerations
Safety First: Your safety is paramount. Leave any situation where you feel unsafe or pressured.
Communication: Open and honest communication with your partner is essential. Discuss boundaries, desires, and concerns.
Consent is Essential: Ensure that all sexual activity is consensual. Understand the legal definition of consent as outlined in the Sexual Offences Act 2003.
Self-Worth: You deserve respect and dignity, regardless of your housing situation.
Seek Support: Do not hesitate to reach out to the services listed for help and advice.

Advocacy: If you are having difficulty accessing services or feel your rights are not being respected, seek advocacy support from a local organization or support worker.
Trauma-Informed Care: Many people experiencing homelessness have a history of trauma. Services should be delivered in a trauma-informed way, which means being aware of the impact of trauma and providing support in a way that promotes healing and avoids re-traumatization.
